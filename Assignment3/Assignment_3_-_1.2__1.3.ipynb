    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "We investigate the nature and construction of both 1 dimensional and 2 dimensional cellular automata as well as it's applications to pseudo-random number generation. Cellular automata are systems which have many different cells that exist either in an on or off state and evolve to the next state over a time step according to a set of predetermined rules. In Task 1 we investigate the nature of single cellular \"Wolfram\" automata, which consist of an arbitrary number of cells in a row which evolve based on the current state of the adjacent cells. The evolution rules governing the automata can be reduced to a single 8-bit binary integer, and this allowed us to write a program which generates a sequence of 1 dimensional automata for any number of tiem steps.\n",
    "\n",
    "Using the egnerated sequences of automata, we limit the number of cells to 64 in order to emulate a binary representation of a 64-bit integer. We analyzed the usefulness of cellular automata as a pseudo-random number generator by measureing the Shannon entropy of the generated sequences multiple times, using different definitions of the possible outcomes of the system for the calculation to determine the best approach. The highest entropy rule could then be used to generate psudo-random number sequences.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally we also analyzed a 2 dimensional cellular automata known as Conway's Game of Life. By allowing the automata to run for large amounts of time we analyzed the steady state behavior of Conway's Game of Life as it related to the intial starting density of the board."
